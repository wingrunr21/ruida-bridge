# Goals

This project intends to build a TypeScript relay server that allows proxying the Ruida protocol for a Ruida based laser to client software such as Lightburn

The project should consist of the socket relay server along with a `/status` endpoint.

Both the relay and the HTTP server should start up via @index.ts

Logging should follow best practices, with differentiated log levels
